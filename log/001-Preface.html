      <p>I’m in the midst of a life experiment switching from living and working in San Francisco to living a semi-nomadic life. It will include many months of slow travel to various countries. I’ve started to call it the 60/40 life.</p>

      <p>The 60/40 Life: The idea of living the majority of your year in different cities, spending months instead of days in a city, and then living the rest of the year in a city you’ve identified as “home”. The decision to live semi-nomadically felt natural, as if the subtleties of life had me pointing towards that direction for years. Here’s 3.</p>

      <p><strong>Working at Airbnb </strong> — 2 years as an Experience Designer flew by. It was most definitely one of the most creative places I’ve worked at, and a place in which I observed the possibilities for redefining the meaning of home. There, I crafted experiences with a talented team and learned a lot about myself in the process. At work, I realized that the open-office way of working didn’t suit me. Instead, I would scope out different corners of our beautiful office space and “work remotely”. Being away from my desk enabled me the space to get in the zone and work productively without distraction and each meeting thereafter felt rejuvenating and useful. I was most productive and happy when I found those pockets of alone work time, and had separate fun social time with coworkers. To summarize: I was looking for balance and wanted to live a lifestyle that allowed me mobility & the ability to be anywhere while working and learning.</p>

      <p> <strong>The idea of home</strong> — I had many conversations with people from all walks of life regarding the balance between work & life, travel, the idea of home, life choices, relationships, and such. Each time illuminating patterns and questions to which the answers I seek. How does the concept of home change when you’re on the road? Is home where you’re from, where you’re most comfortable, a set of people? Is home a constant? Is it not an illusion that it will be constant? How does one reconcile with that fact? Or do you create it? </p>

      <p> <strong>My teachers</strong> — I have been fortunate to have found teachers, quite serendipitously, whom have illuminated paths unknown to me. Greg, my Zen teacher & friend, is kind, patient, and full of life! He’s shared so many books and stories with me over tea. What fond memories I have of this friendship. All this because I walked into Forest books one day! I seek spiritual growth on this journey. For this reason, I am going to be in Japan for a while, and then in China and Taiwan. It all makes a lot of sense to me. Here’s to the wandering days. </p>
